## Tech Used

html, css, javascript, node.js

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple note taking application where the user can keep track of his notes for the week. I would personally use it as a weekly planner, but it is at heart a simple note taker so youre more than welcome to use it as you feel neccessary.

## GIVEN a note-taking application

```
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page √

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
